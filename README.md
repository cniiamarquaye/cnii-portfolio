## 🚀 About This Portfolio

- Built using the [Massively](https://html5up.net/massively) template by HTML5 UP
- Designed for **clarity**, **accessibility**, and **professional presentation**
- Sections include **About**, **Projects**, **Research**, and **Contact**

## 📂 Featured Projects

- **Rainfall-Runoff and Non-Point Source Pollution Loads in the Sakumo Catchment**  
  Quantified surface runoff and pollutant loading patterns in Ghana’s Sakumo catchment using hydrological modeling and spatial analysis.  
  _Insight:_ Identified critical pollution hotspots and provided guidance for improving catchment-scale water quality management.

- **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Change in Ghana’s Sakumo Catchment**  
  Mapped and analyzed long-term LULC dynamics to assess human and natural impacts on wetland health and catchment processes.  
  _Insight:_ Revealed significant urban expansion and wetland degradation, informing sustainable land-use planning.

- **Groundwater Contamination Modelling**  
  Simulated contaminant transport in unconfined and confined aquifers using **COMSOL Multiphysics** to evaluate groundwater vulnerability.  
  _Insight:_ Predicted contaminant plume behavior, supporting effective groundwater protection and remediation strategies.

- **Pesticide Transport & Soil Reactions**  
  Developed coupled flow and reactive transport models to study pesticide migration and chemical interactions within soil-water systems.  
  _Insight:_ Showed how soil properties and reactions influence pesticide retention and groundwater contamination risks.

- **Terzaghi Compaction Analysis**  
  Modeled vertical compaction in aquifers caused by groundwater withdrawal, applying **Terzaghi’s theory** to predict subsidence risks.  
  _Insight:_ Demonstrated how excessive pumping accelerates land subsidence, supporting better groundwater extraction policies.
