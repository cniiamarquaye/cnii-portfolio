		<h2>üîç Project Snapshot</h2>
            <p>
                From 1970 to 2015 alone, there has been a 35% global loss of coastal wetlands due to 
                unprecedented threats from industrialisation, urbanisation, and climate change. 
                This project demonstrates the application of advanced geospatial technologies to 
                address critical environmental challenges facing coastal wetlands in Ghana. 
                Using two designated Ramsar sites (Sakumo and Songor wetlands) as case studies, 
                this project employed multi-temporal remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020 to 
                quantify land use and land cover (LULC) changes in these ecologically significant 
                areas‚Äîinternational ecosystems recognized for their biodiversity importance.

			<!-- Key Objectives -->
			<h2>üìå Key Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                This project aimed to provide an evidence-based synthesis that potentially diagnoses 
                the causes, pace, and mechanics the Sakumo and Songor catchments undergo with the aid 
                of geospatial science. This provides a clearer and comprehensive approach to arrive at 
                informed conservation policies and sustainable land management planning.

                In achieving this, the following objectives served as milestones;
                <li> Quantify LULC changes in the Sakumo and Songor catchments from 1990 to 2020,</li>
                <li> Determine the dynamics of LULC change with intensity analysis, and</li>
                <li> Evaluate the primary drivers influencing the observed LULC changes by integrating natural and anthropogenic data.</li>

                <p>
                    This flowchart outlines the multi-stage process from data acquisition to final change detection, 
                    ensuring the results are derived from pre-processed, accurately classified satellite imagery.

                <h3>Data Acquisition & Pre-processing</h3>
                <p>
                    For a robust temporal analysis of environmental changes spanning from 1990 to 2020, 
                    this research used the <strong>Landsat Collection 2 Level 1 satellite imagery</strong>
                    (Landsat-4 TM, Landsat-7 ETM, Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS) obtained from the USGS Earth Explorer platform.
                    The 30-year study period allowed for comprehensive tracking of landscape transformations 
                    in both wetland catchments. 
                    All images underwent rigorous atmospheric correction using the 
                    Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method and were processed to calculate various spectral 
                    indices to accurately isolate wetland features. 
                    These indices included the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
                    Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, ancillary data such as <strong>topographical data</strong> (Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle 
                    Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)) and <strong>climatic data (rainfall, temperature, etc.)</strong> from remote sources 
                    (CHIRPS and TerraClimate) were compared to available ground data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency were integrated 
                    to provide context for hydrological modelling. 
                    Population data from national censuses and remote datasets were also incorporated to assess anthropogenic pressures.
                </p>

                <h3>Analytical Framework</h3>
                <p>
                    The analytical approach incorporated supervised classification techniques with post-classification 
                    comparison to quantify changes across different time intervals (~10 years). Four classification
                    algorithms were evaluated: Maximum Likelihood, Random Trees, Support Vector Machine 
                    and K-nearest neighbour. The Maximum Likelihood algorithm was selected for its superior accuracy 
                    in distinguishing complex wetland habitats.

                    The research employed <strong>intensity analysis</strong>‚Äîa hierarchical framework that
                    reveals not just what changed, but how fast and how systematically those changes occurred.
                    This sophisticated approach allowed for detailed identification of systematic transitions between 
                    land categories and provided insights into the dynamics of change processes.
                    
                    The findings were validated through ground-truthing exercises and historical map comparisons, 
                    achieving classification accuracy of <strong>72% for Sakumo</strong> and <strong>77% for Songor</strong>.

			<h2>üí° Key Insights</h2>
                <h3>LULC Change Dynamics</h3>
			<p>
                <li>The analysis revealed dramatic transformations in both Ramsar sites over the 30-year study period. 
                The Sakumo wetland catchment experienced a significant expansion of built-up areas 
                primarily at the expense of mangrove forests and water bodies. 
                Meanwhile, agricultural land increased, reflecting growing food production demands in the region. 
                The Songor wetland catchment showed slightly different but equally concerning patterns, 
                with 'urban' expansion driven largely by salt mining operations and agricultural development. 
                These anthropogenic and natural factors drove the rate and spate of LULC changes. 
                However, their extents and influence have not been significantly quantified.</li>

                        The bar charts quantify the dramatic decline in wetland cover (such as a loss of over 60% in Sakumo by 2020) 
                        and the rapid rise of urban (in Sakumo) and agricultural land (in Songor). This confirms the trends observed in

            <p>    
                <li>The intensity analysis demonstrated that changes in the Sakumo wetland catchment were predominantly 
                concentrated in human-induced LULC categories, while the Songor wetland catchment changes were more 
                influenced by natural processes, the anthropogenic factors still played a substantial role. 
                The research attributed these changes primarily to population dynamics and economic pressures, 
                with climate change acting as an additional stressor on these vulnerable ecosystems.
                The population growth curve correlates strongly with LULC shifts, highlighting the human
                pressures on the natural resources.</li>
            
                <li>To that effect, key drivers influencing the LULC changes in the catchments were assessed. 
                These drivers were <strong>population growth</strong> and <strong>hydro-climatic factors</strong> 
                (including temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and potential water availability).</li>
                
                <li>Local population data (from the Ghana Statistical Service for 2010 and 2021) and remote datasets 
                (from 2000 - 2020 (for Landscan and WorldPop) and from 1990 - 2020 (for GlobPOP)) were compared. 
                Though Sakumo registered a higher population density, Songor showed faster growth rate. 
                This is possibly due to inhabitants migration for <strong>greener pastures</strong> in urban areas.</li>

            <h2>üåø Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Impacts</h2>
                <p>
                    The conversion of natural habitats has led to substantial declines in ecosystem services provided by 
                    these wetlands. The loss of mangrove forests has reduced natural buffering capacity against coastal 
                    erosion and storm surges, while the degradation of water bodies has diminished their water purification 
                    functions and fisheries support capacity. The research documented correlative evidence between LULC changes 
                    and declining populations of migratory birds and other wildlife that depend on these habitats, highlighting 
                    the conservation implications of these transformations.
                </p>
                
                <h3>üå¥üè¢ Sustainability Implications: Contributions to Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
                    <p>
                        This research provides critical insights for achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals. 
                        For <strong>SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)</strong>, the findings inform strategies for protecting 
                        water-related ecosystems. 
                        For <strong>SDG 13 (Climate Action)</strong>, the study highlights the role of wetlands in climate 
                        change mitigation through carbon sequestration and climate adaptation through buffering extreme weather events. 
                        For <strong>SDGs 14</strong> and <strong>15 (Life Below Water and Life on Land)</strong>, the research offers
                        empirical evidence of human impacts on coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, supporting targeted conservation 
                        interventions.
                        The <strong>catchment-based approach</strong> aligns directly with <strong>SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and 
                        Communities)</strong> by demonstrating the connections between urban development patterns and ecosystem health. 
                        The research also contributes to <strong>SDGs 1</strong> and <strong>2 (No Poverty and Zero Hunger)</strong> 
                        by documenting how environmental changes affect community livelihoods that depend on wetland resources, 
                        highlighting the need for balanced approaches that support both conservation and sustainable use.

                <h3>‚öñÔ∏è Policy Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Based on the findings, the study recommended <strong>integrated management strategies</strong> that 
                        address the root causes of wetland degradation while promoting sustainable development. 
                        Specific policy interventions include:
                        <li><strong>Zoning regulations</strong> that limit urban expansion into ecologically sensitive areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incentive programs</strong> for sustainable agricultural practices that reduce wetland pollution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community-based conservation</strong> initiatives that engage local stakeholders in wetland management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Climate adaptation plans</strong> that incorporate wetland protection as a key strategy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strengthened governance</strong> frameworks that coordinate across different sectors and jurisdictions.</li>
                    </p>
